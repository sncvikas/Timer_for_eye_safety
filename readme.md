# This java application assists you is protecting your eyes against long screen times.
## Application is based on popular 20-20-20 rule which says
    for every 20 minutes look away from screen at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
<br>

## How it works?
Once you hit 'Start timer' on the application, it starts a timer that runs repeatedly until you, and it shows a notification at the bottom of the screen every 20 minutes reminding you to look away<br><br>
